# Senior DevOps: Advanced Infrastructure & Automation

## Pattern 1: AI-Assisted IaC Generation
Use GitHub Copilot to generate Terraform, CloudFormation, and Kubernetes manifests with proper validation and security practices.

## Pattern 2: Intelligent CI/CD Pipelines
Build self-optimizing pipelines that use AI to predict build failures, optimize caching, and parallelize test execution.

## Pattern 3: Automated Incident Response
Create AI-powered runbooks that analyze logs, identify root causes, and suggest remediation steps during incidents.

## Pattern 4: Infrastructure Cost Optimization
Use AI to analyze cloud spending patterns and generate recommendations for right-sizing and cost reduction.

## Pattern 5: Security Automation
Implement AI-assisted security scanning, vulnerability assessment, and automated compliance checking in deployment pipelines.

## Next Steps
- Progress to [Lead Practices](./devops-lead-practices) for multi-team coordination
- Review [Principal Practices](./devops-principal-practices) for org strategy
