# DevOps Guide: Getting Started

Welcome to the DevOps Guide! This section helps DevOps engineers use AI tools effectively for infrastructure, automation, and deployment.

## Your Role as DevOps

As a DevOps engineer, AI tools can help you with:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Generate Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Create and maintain pipeline configurations
- **Deployment Scripts**: Generate automation scripts
- **Monitoring Setup**: Configure alerts and dashboards
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug infrastructure issues

## Key Areas

### Infrastructure Automation

AI tools can generate:
- Terraform configurations
- CloudFormation templates
- Kubernetes manifests
- Docker configurations

### CI/CD Pipelines

AI tools can help with:
- Pipeline configuration
- Build scripts
- Deployment automation
- Testing in pipelines

### Monitoring and Observability

AI tools can assist with:
- Alert configurations
- Dashboard setup
- Log analysis
- Performance monitoring

## Important Reminders

- **Review all infrastructure code** - Security is critical
- **Test configurations** - Don't deploy untested infrastructure
- **Follow organizational policies** - Infrastructure must comply
- **Document changes** - Maintain infrastructure documentation
