# Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the Developer Guide! This section will help you learn how to effectively use GitHub Copilot as your AI pair programmer.

## What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that suggests code as you type. It's not an autopilot—think of it as a sophisticated pair programmer that helps you write code faster while maintaining quality.

## Key Concepts

### Code Completion (Ghost Text)
Gray text suggestions that appear inline as you type. Best for boilerplate and repetitive patterns.

### Code Generation from Comments
Write descriptive comments, and Copilot will generate the implementation. This is called "Comment-Driven Development."

### Unit Test Generation
Use Copilot Chat or highlight actions to generate test cases for your functions.

### Refactoring
Ask Copilot to refactor specific code blocks to improve readability, performance, or maintainability.

## Learning Path

1. **Beginner**: Start with [Code Completion](../daily-usage/code-completion) to understand basic usage
2. **Intermediate**: Learn [Code Generation from Comments](../daily-usage/code-generation-comments) for more complex logic
3. **Advanced**: Master [Refactoring Techniques](../daily-usage/refactoring) and understand [Anti-Patterns](../daily-usage/anti-patterns)

## Important Reminders

- Always review AI-generated code before accepting
- Never commit code without reading it first
- Verify test assertions when using AI-generated tests
- Check for security vulnerabilities in AI-suggested code

## Next Steps

- Read about [Code Completion](../daily-usage/code-completion)
- Learn about [Anti-Patterns](../daily-usage/anti-patterns) to avoid common mistakes
- Explore [Code Examples](../examples/python-example) to see patterns in action
