4. Unmet needs and opportunities
5. Notable quotes for each theme
```

### 2. Persona Creation

**Prompt Template:**
```
Create a user persona based on this research data:

Research findings:
- [Demographics]
- [Behaviors]
- [Goals]
- [Pain points]
- [Technology usage]

Include:
1. Persona name and photo description
2. Background and demographics
3. Goals and motivations
4. Frustrations and pain points
5. Typical behaviors
6. Technology proficiency
7. Quote that captures their mindset
```

### 3. Journey Mapping

4. Onboarding
5. Regular usage
6. Renewal/Advocacy

For each stage include:
- User actions
- Thoughts and emotions
- Pain points
- Opportunities
```

### 4. Usability Testing Analysis

**Prompt Template:**
```
Analyze these usability testing findings:

Test scenario: [Description]
Participants: [Number and type]

Observations:
[Paste key observations from sessions]

Identify:
1. Critical usability issues (Priority 1)
2. Moderate issues (Priority 2)
3. Minor issues (Priority 3)
4. Positive patterns and successes
5. Recommended solutions for top issues
```

### 5. Information Architecture

**Prompt Template:**
```
Help me organize this content into a logical IA:
