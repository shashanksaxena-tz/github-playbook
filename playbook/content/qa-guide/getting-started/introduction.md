# QA Guide: Getting Started

Welcome to the QA Guide! This section helps QA engineers use AI tools effectively for testing, test generation, and quality assurance.

## Your Role as QA

As a QA engineer, AI tools can help you with:

- **Test Generation**: Create comprehensive test suites
- **Test Data**: Generate test fixtures and mock data
- **Test Maintenance**: Update tests when code changes
- **Bug Analysis**: Understand and document bugs
- **Test Strategy**: Plan testing approaches

## Key Areas

### Test Generation

AI tools can generate:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests
- Test data and fixtures

**See**: [Test Generation](../../developer-guide/daily-usage/test-generation.md) for detailed guidance.

### Test-Driven Development

Learn how to use AI in TDD workflow:
- Generate tests first
- Verify test assertions
- Implement to pass tests
- Refactor while maintaining tests

**See**: [TDD with AI](../../shared/ai-native-sdlc/tdd-with-ai.md) for complete workflow.

### Test Quality

Ensure AI-generated tests are:
- Accurate (verify assertions)
- Comprehensive (cover edge cases)
- Maintainable (follow patterns)
- Reliable (no flaky tests)

## Important Reminders

- **Always verify test assertions** - AI may guess wrong expected values
- **Review generated tests** - Don't blindly accept AI suggestions
- **Maintain test quality** - Follow team testing standards
- **Update tests regularly** - Keep tests in sync with code

## Next Steps

- Learn [Test Generation](../../developer-guide/daily-usage/test-generation.md)
- Explore [TDD with AI](../../shared/ai-native-sdlc/tdd-with-ai.md)
- Review [Testing Templates](../../shared/prompt-engineering/templates/testing.md)
