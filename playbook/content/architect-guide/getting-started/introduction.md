# Getting Started: Establishing AI Standards

Welcome to the Architect Guide! This section helps you establish organizational standards for AI tool adoption, create governance policies, and set up context management practices for your team.

## Your Role as an Architect

As an architect or engineering lead, you're responsible for:

- **Model Selection Strategy**: Choosing the right AI models for different tasks
- **Context Management**: Establishing practices for maintaining AI context
- **Governance Policies**: Creating rules for safe and effective AI tool usage
- **Team Enablement**: Enabling developers to use AI tools effectively

## Key Areas to Address

### 1. Model Selection

Different AI models are optimized for different tasks:

- **Flash/Turbo Models**: High-velocity tasks (autocomplete, simple refactors)
- **High-Reasoning Models**: Complex architecture, debugging, security auditing
- **Deep Reasoning Models**: Algorithm design, systematic reviews

See [Model Selection Strategy](../standards/model-selection) for detailed guidance.

### 2. Context Management

Effective context management ensures AI tools understand your codebase:

- **Open-Tab Strategy**: Keep relevant files open
- **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**: Project-specific coding guidelines
- **Specification Files**: Maintain specs as source of truth

See [Context Management](../standards/context-management) for implementation details.

### 3. Governance

Establish policies for:

- Data privacy and IP protection
- Security checkpoints
- Human-in-the-loop requirements
- Acceptable use policies

See [Governance Policies](../governance/governance-policies) for policy templates.

## Creating Your AI Adoption Policy

Follow these steps to create a team-specific policy:

1. **Assess Current State**: Understand how your team currently uses AI tools
2. **Define Model Strategy**: Choose models for different use cases
3. **Establish Context Practices**: Set up context management guidelines
4. **Create Governance Rules**: Define security and compliance requirements
5. **Set Up Checkpoints**: Identify mandatory human review points
6. **Document and Train**: Create documentation and train your team

## Next Steps

- Read [Model Selection Strategy](../standards/model-selection) to choose appropriate models
- Review [Context Management](../standards/context-management) for setup practices
- Explore [Governance Policies](../governance/governance-policies) for policy templates
- Check [Human Oversight](../governance/human-oversight) for mandatory checkpoints
