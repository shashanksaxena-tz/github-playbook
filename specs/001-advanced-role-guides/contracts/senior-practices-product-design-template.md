## Advanced Domain Patterns

This section demonstrates 3-5 sophisticated AI-assisted {role} patterns that go beyond intermediate-level techniques.

### Pattern 1: [Descriptive Pattern Name]

**Context**: [Explain when to use this pattern - specific situations where it solves a real problem]

**AI Tool**: [ChatGPT-4 | Claude | Midjourney | Figma AI | Miro AI | etc.]

**Prompt Example**:
```text
[Role-specific prompt that demonstrates the R.I.C.E. or similar framework]

For Product Roles:
- Role: Act as a Senior {Role} with expertise in [specific domain]
- Input: [Specific task like "Generate user stories for feature X"]
- Context: Target audience, business goals, constraints
- Example: [Show desired output format]

For Design Roles:
- Role: Act as a Senior {Role} with expertise in [specific design domain]
- Input: [Specific task like "Create accessibility-compliant UI patterns"]
- Context: Design system guidelines, brand constraints, accessibility requirements
- Example: [Show desired output format]
```

**Generated Output**:
```
[Show the AI-generated output with annotations]

✅ Good practice: [Explain what makes this approach good]
[Output demonstrating the pattern]

⚠️ Watch out: [Common pitfall or consideration]
[Output showing proper handling]

💡 Human refinement: [What needs human expertise/adjustment]
[Refined output after human input]
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ [Benefit 1: e.g., Accelerates initial ideation without sacrificing quality]
- ✅ [Benefit 2: e.g., Provides structure for complex domain work]
- ✅ [Benefit 3: e.g., Enables more time for strategic thinking]

**Common Pitfalls**:
- ❌ [Anti-pattern 1: e.g., Accepting AI output without domain validation]
- ❌ [Anti-pattern 2: e.g., Using AI for tasks requiring deep stakeholder knowledge]

**Measuring Success**:
- [Metric 1: e.g., Time to create initial draft reduced by 40%]
- [Metric 2: e.g., Stakeholder feedback shows 30% improvement in clarity]

### Pattern 2: [Another Advanced Pattern]

[Follow the same structure as Pattern 1, with role-appropriate examples:

**Product Owner Examples**:
- AI-assisted backlog grooming and prioritization
- Automated user story generation from product requirements
- Sprint planning optimization with data analysis

**Product Manager Examples**:
- Market research synthesis and competitive analysis
- Feature prioritization using AI-analyzed data
- Go-to-market strategy development

**UI Designer Examples**:
- Design system component variation generation
- Responsive layout exploration with constraints
- Accessibility compliance pattern generation

**UX Designer Examples**:
- User journey map generation from research data
- Persona creation with AI-synthesized insights
- Usability test plan generation
]

### Pattern 3: [Third Advanced Pattern]

[Follow the same structure as Pattern 1]

---

### Pattern 4: [Optional Fourth Pattern]

[Include if you have 4-5 patterns specific to the role]

---

### Pattern 5: [Optional Fifth Pattern]

[Include if you have 4-5 patterns specific to the role]

## Mentorship & Domain Excellence

As a senior professional, you're expected to mentor others and elevate quality across your team.

### AI-Assisted Quality Review

**Domain-Specific Review**:
- Use AI to validate completeness of deliverables
- Example prompts:
  - Product Owner: "Review this user story for completeness. Check acceptance criteria, edge cases, and testability."
  - Product Manager: "Analyze this feature proposal for market fit, competitive positioning, and risk factors."
  - UI Designer: "Review this design for accessibility compliance, responsive behavior, and design system consistency."
  - UX Designer: "Evaluate this research plan for completeness, bias prevention, and actionable insights potential."

**Cross-Functional Communication**:
- Use AI to translate technical concepts for different audiences
- Generate documentation that serves multiple stakeholder groups
- Create presentations tailored to different experience levels

### Mentoring Junior Professionals

**Teaching AI Tool Usage**:
1. **Show, Don't Tell**: Demonstrate your prompting process in collaboration sessions
2. **Explain Your Review**: When reviewing AI-generated work, explain what you're validating and why
3. **Set Boundaries**: Teach when NOT to use AI (sensitive stakeholder conversations, highly confidential work, nuanced strategic decisions)

**Common Questions to Address**:
- Q: "Should I use this AI-generated deliverable as-is?"
  - A: "Review it like any work product. Validate against domain knowledge, user needs, and business constraints."
- Q: "The AI generated something that seems good but I'm not confident. Should I use it?"
  - A: "No. You must be able to defend your work. Refine it until you fully understand and can advocate for every decision."

**Pair Working with AI**:
- Collaborate with junior team members on AI-assisted tasks
- Walk through your prompting iteration process
- Show how you validate, refine, and integrate AI suggestions
- Explain your domain expertise signals that catch AI errors

## Domain Optimization & Excellence

### AI-Assisted Process Optimization

**Workflow Efficiency**:
```text
For Product Roles:
Prompt: "Given this [backlog/roadmap], suggest prioritization approaches considering [business goals, technical constraints, team capacity]. Provide decision criteria."

For Design Roles:
Prompt: "Given these [design patterns/components], suggest optimization approaches for [accessibility/performance/maintainability]. Provide evaluation criteria."
```

**Quality Enhancement Flow**:
1. Identify process bottleneck or quality gap
2. Use AI to suggest multiple improvement approaches
3. Evaluate options against domain constraints
4. Implement and measure impact
5. Document decision rationale for team learning

### Role-Specific Excellence Patterns

[Add 2-3 role-specific excellence patterns. Examples:

**For Product Owner**: 
- AI-assisted story mapping and dependency analysis
- Automated acceptance criteria generation with edge case coverage
- Data-driven sprint retrospective insights

**For Product Manager**:
- Competitive intelligence synthesis with trend analysis
- AI-powered feature impact modeling
- Customer feedback categorization and insight extraction

**For UI Designer**:
- Design system component variant generation
- Automated design token management
- Visual regression testing setup with AI-assisted test case generation

**For UX Designer**:
- AI-assisted research synthesis and pattern identification
- Automated journey map generation from qualitative data
- Usability metrics analysis and recommendation generation

- **Quality Improvement**: Improvement in deliverable quality from professionals you mentor
- **AI Adoption**: Team members using AI effectively without compromising domain expertise

### Professional Influence

- **Documentation**: Quality and usage of frameworks/templates you create
- **Problem Solving**: Time to resolution for complex domain challenges (track trend)

### Role-Specific Metrics

**Product Owner**:

- User story acceptance rate on first review
- Backlog health (clear, estimated, prioritized)

**Product Manager**:
- Feature success rate (adoption, usage, satisfaction)

**UI Designer**:
- Design system adoption rate
- Time to prototype high-fidelity designs
- Accessibility compliance score

**UX Designer**:
