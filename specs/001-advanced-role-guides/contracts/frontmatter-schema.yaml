## Validation Rules

### ID Validation
- Must follow format: `{role}-{level}-practices`
- Role must be one of: developer, architect, qa, devops
- Level must be one of: senior, lead, principal
- Must be unique across all documents in the repository

### Title Validation
- Length: 10-100 characters
- Should clearly indicate role and experience level
- Use title case or sentence case consistently

### Description Validation
- Length: 50-150 characters
- Should mention:
  1. Content type (patterns, frameworks, case studies)
  2. Target audience (role + experience level)
  3. Years of experience range

### Cross References Validation
- Minimum 2 references required
- All referenced IDs must exist in the repository
- Should include:
  - At least 1 reference to lower experience level (if applicable)
  - At least 1 reference to related content in same role guide
  - Optional: cross-role references for multi-disciplinary topics

### Tags Validation
- 3-7 tags required (not too few, not too many)
- Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
- Include at least:
  - Experience level tag (e.g., "senior-developer", "lead-architect")
  - Content type tag (e.g., "advanced-patterns", "team-adoption", "governance")
  - Tool/technology tag (e.g., "ai-assisted-development", "github-copilot")

### Date Validation
- Must be valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Should be updated when content changes significantly
- Must not be in the future

## Automated Validation

This schema can be validated using tools like:
- **yamllint**: Validate YAML syntax
- **Custom scripts**: Check field presence, format, and cross-reference validity
- **CI/CD hooks**: Automatically validate on commit/PR

### Example Validation Script (Pseudocode)

```python
def validate_frontmatter(document_path):
    frontmatter = parse_yaml_frontmatter(document_path)
    
    # Required field checks
    assert 'id' in frontmatter
    assert 'title' in frontmatter
    assert 'role' in frontmatter
    assert 'experience_level' in frontmatter
    assert 'workflow_stage' in frontmatter
    assert 'description' in frontmatter
    assert 'cross_references' in frontmatter
    assert 'tags' in frontmatter
    assert 'last_updated' in frontmatter
    
    # Format checks
    assert re.match(r'^(developer|architect|qa|devops)-(senior|lead|principal)-practices$', frontmatter['id'])
    assert frontmatter['role'] in ['developer', 'architect', 'qa', 'devops']
    assert frontmatter['experience_level'] in ['senior', 'lead', 'principal']
    assert frontmatter['workflow_stage'] == 'advanced'
    assert 10 <= len(frontmatter['title']) <= 100
    assert 50 <= len(frontmatter['description']) <= 150
    assert 3 <= len(frontmatter['tags']) <= 7
    assert len(frontmatter['cross_references']) >= 2
    assert re.match(r'^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$', frontmatter['last_updated'])
    
    # Cross-reference validation
    for ref_id in frontmatter['cross_references']:
        assert document_exists(ref_id)
    
    return True
```

## Maintenance Notes

- Review frontmatter schema quarterly for new field requirements
- Update examples when new patterns emerge
- Keep validation rules in sync with data model
- Document any schema changes with rationale
